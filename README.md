# Events-Platform Frontend

## Project Summary:

#### This project showcases the frontend of an events app using Vite, React, and javaScript.

#### Features include the ability to view all existing events and users; the ability to create a staff account and post new events, and delete any events posted from your account. It is also possible to sign up to an event, and add it to your google calendar. It also includes the feature of checking the weather at the Location of the event - this is using the OpenWeather API. This comes with the limitation that not all locations will be able to access weather if they are not included in the API.
